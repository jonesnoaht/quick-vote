# Quick Vote

Everyone who wants to vote provides a wallet address with his or her
name. The candidates are enumerated. The vote wallet mints tokens 
$n + 1$ where $n$ is the number candidates. The wallets then send tokens in
number according to the number of the person for whom they want to
vote and $n + 1$ in the case of no-confidence.
